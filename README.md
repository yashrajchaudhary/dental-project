# dental-project
created an automated dental implant placement planning software using CNN algorithm and Tensorflow libaries

 Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

Imports

The code starts by importing several libraries:

streamlit as st: This library is used to create a web app interface.
numpy as np: This library provides functions for numerical operations.
nibabel as nib: This library is used to load and manipulate medical imaging data in NIfTI format.
plotly.graph_objs as go: This library is used to create visualizations in Plotly.
tensorflow as tf: This library is used for machine learning tasks, including loading the pre-trained model for implant prediction.
from PIL import Image: This library is used to load and manipulate image files.
os: This library provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as deleting temporary files.
Load the Trained Model

The code then loads a pre-trained Keras model using tf.keras.models.load_model. The model is likely trained to predict implant coordinates based on medical images (CT scans and X-rays).

Functions

The code defines several functions:

load_ct_image(image_path): This function takes the path to a CT scan image in NIfTI format and loads it using nib.load. It then returns the image data as a NumPy array.
create_3d_scatter_plot(data): This function takes a 3D NumPy array representing CT scan data and creates a 3D scatter plot using Plotly. It identifies voxels with non-zero values as points to visualize the structure in 3D space.
preprocess_ct_image(data): This function preprocesses a CT scan image for model prediction. It takes a middle slice of the 3D data, converts it to a 3-channel image (assuming the model expects RGB input), resizes it to a specific size required by the model, and normalizes the pixel values between 0 and 1.
load_xray_image(image_file): This function takes the path to an X-ray image file and loads it using Pillow (PIL Fork). It ensures the image is in RGB format, resizes it to match the model's input size, and normalizes the pixel values.
Streamlit UI

The code uses Streamlit to create a web app interface:

It sets a title for the app: "3D CT Scan & X-ray Visualization and Implant Prediction".
It creates two file uploaders:
One for uploading CT scans in NIfTI format (".nii" or ".nii.gz" extensions).
Another for uploading X-ray images in JPEG, PNG, or JPG formats.
Processing CT Scans

When a CT scan is uploaded:

The CT scan data is saved to a temporary file with the path ct_image.nii.gz.
A spinner is displayed while the CT scan is being loaded.
The load_ct_image function is used to load the CT scan data.
The create_3d_scatter_plot function is used to create a 3D scatter plot of the CT scan data and display it using Streamlit's plotly_chart function.
The preprocess_ct_image function is used to preprocess the CT scan data for prediction.
The model is used to predict implant coordinates from the preprocessed CT scan data.
The predicted implant coordinates (X and Y) are displayed on the app.
Error Handling

The code includes an try-except block to handle potential errors during CT scan processing. If an error occurs, an error message is displayed on the app.

Cleanup

After processing the CT scan, the temporary file containing the CT scan data is deleted using os.remove.

Processing X-ray Images

When an X-ray image is uploaded:

The uploaded image is displayed on the app.
The load_xray_image function is used to load and preprocess the X-ray image.
The model is used to predict implant coordinates from the preprocessed X-ray image.
The predicted implant coordinates (X and Y) are displayed on the app.
